## English Short Description

This research aims to investigate the feasibility of using imitation learning to build a potentially realistic driver model to simulate situations after a TOR has been issued. The main objective is to evaluate the performance of the proposed driver model in terms of its ability to accurately mimic human driving behavior, and to determine if it can be used to optimize the handover process between an autonomous vehicle and a driver.
